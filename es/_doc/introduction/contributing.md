If you're interested in contributing code, the best starting point is to have a
look at our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues) to
see which tasks are the most urgent. You can filter issues depending on your
interest and experience. For example, here are some common issue labels:

* [Help wanted](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22&utf8=%E2%9C%93)
* [UX and usability](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AUX)
* [Windows tools](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22C%3A+windows+tools%22)
* [Documentation](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22C%3A+doc%22)
* [Privacy](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22privacy%22%20)

Before you engage in an activity that will take you a significant amount of
time, like implementing a new feature, it's always good to contact us first,
preferably via the [qubes-devel](/es/support/#qubes-devel) mailing list. Once
we've worked out the details, we'll be grateful to [receive your
patch](/es/doc/source-code/#how-to-send-patches).
