A **Qubes Security Bulletin (QSB)** is a security announcement issued by the
[Qubes Security Team](/es/security/#qubes-security-team) through the [Qubes
Security Pack](/es/security/pack/). A QSB typically provides a summary and impact
analysis of one or more recently-discovered software vulnerabilities, including
details about patching to address them.
